How to deploy PAR

I. deploy backend
- 1 unpack server folder to any place, say "$par"
- 3 run data generation pipeline: cd bin; make llevel5 com=mozilla
- 4 train model: ./runR.sh mozilla
- 4 copy output file: cp rscript/predictedIssues.res ../data/mozilla/.
- 5 edit $par/server/bin/runPredictMoz.sh, line 3: appRoot="$par/server"
- 6 same to $par/server/bin/setThresholdMoz.sh, line 3
- 7 Delete all the quote(") in the first line of $par/data/mozilla/predictedIssues.res 
- 8 generate quantile table: python $par/server/bin/application/generateQuantileTable.py $par/server/data/mozilla/predictedIssues.res > $par/server/data/mozilla/quantileTable

II. deploy frontend (apache server is required)
- 1 unpack front folder/* to apache www folder
- 2 edit www/predict.php, line 12, change the path to $par/server/bin/runPredictMoz.sh
- 3 edit www/setThreshold.php, line 14, change the path to $par/server/bin/setThresholdMoz.sh
- 4 start apache server, you should be able to access the site (index.html).
- 5 pay attention to execution permission of *.sh/*.py files and read/write permission of data files.
- 6 pay attention to the action attributes of html forms in *.html and *.php

This repository _is not_ the original repository for this tool. Here are some links to the original project:
* [The Official Project Page, including source code](https://github.com/minghuizhou/PAR.git)
* [A Video of the Tool](http://youtu.be/IuykbzSTj8s)

In this repository, for PAR you will find:
* :white_check_mark: [Source code](https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringToolDemos/ICSE-2014-PAR) (available)
* :x: Executable tool (not available)
* :x: Virtual machine containing tool (not available)

This repository was constructed by [Yi-Chun Chen(RimiChen)](https://github.com/RimiChen) under the supervision of [Emerson Murphy-Hill](https://github.com/CaptainEmerson). 

Thank for all assistances from Dr. Minghui Zhou and her colleagues. 
Though I had not successfully downloaded installation required data and failed to get it work, due to the limited network speed.


-------------------------------
Some installation instruction from authors: (for who want to get it work)

Note,  you need to get two data files (info_level1 and activity_level2) from below and put them on the directory of PAR/server/data/mozilla/:

https://passion-lab.org/subtopic/data_mozilla.php
Click "Bug", and:

at Level 1, click "Info Data" (info_level1, 3.1G)

at Level 2, click   "Activity Data" (activity_level2, 538M)
